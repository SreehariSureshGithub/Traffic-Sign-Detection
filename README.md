## Traffic Sign Recognition Using CNN
Introduction
This project is focused on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify traffic signs. The system includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction, allowing users to upload images of traffic signs and receive predictions about the sign's category. This tool can be particularly useful for driver assistance systems.

# Features
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: The model is trained to recognize various traffic signs, including speed limits, one-way roads, and other regulatory signs.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly interface allows users to upload images and view the model's predictions.
Real-Time Warnings: Provides real-time feedback to assist drivers in understanding road signs.
Diverse Dataset: The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset to ensure accurate predictions across different sign types and conditions.
